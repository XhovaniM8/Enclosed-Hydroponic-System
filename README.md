## 🔧 Architecture

The system follows a **closed-loop feedback control model**:
1. **Sensors** collect environmental data.
2. **Arduino** processes inputs and determines actions.
3. **Relays** actuate pumps and dispensers.
4. **User-defined plant parameters** govern behavior dynamically.
5. **Real-time data streaming** supports monitoring/debugging.

> Inspired by Ebb and Flow systems, with a modular build and low maintenance requirements.
